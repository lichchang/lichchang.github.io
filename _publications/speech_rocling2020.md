In this study, we focus on developing a novel noise-robust speech feature extraction
technique to achieve noise-robust speech recognition, which employs the information from
the backend acoustic models. Without further retraining and adapting the backend acoustic
models, we use deep neural networks to learn the front-end acoustic speech feature
representation that can achieve the maximum state accuracy obtained from the original
acoustic models. Compared with the robustness methods that retrain or adapt acoustic models,
the presented method exhibits the advantages of lower computational complexity and faster
training.
In the preliminary evaluation experiments conducted with the median-vocabulary TIMIT
database and task, we show that the newly presented method achieves lower word error rates
in recognition under various noise types and levels compared with the baseline results.
Therefore, this method is quite promising and worth developing further.
