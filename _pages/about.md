I am currently conducting AI research at a leading Gen AI research lab at NC State University, contributing to the advancement of AGI. My vision for the AGI system involves a centralized, adaptable AI model that functions as a customizable brain, evolving based on various customer scenarios. This central AI would be interconnected with specialized smaller AI models, each designed to address domain-specific tasks. This big picture is the primary focus of my research efforts.


I believe that AGI is within reach and could become a reality in the next few years. In my view, multimodal models represent the next major breakthrough in the AI field, enabling LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities for actions and movements through video data and interactive simulations. To contribute to this vision, my research focuses on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and optimizing multimodal model efficiency, with an emphasis on embodied AI where LLMs are trained in simulation environments.
