I am a first-year Ph.D. student at NC State University CSC, advised by Prof. Dongkuan Xu.

I earned a Master's in Computer Science from NC State University and another Master of Science from National Chi Nan University in Taiwan back in 2020.

My research interests lie in Efficient Embodied AI and Agentic AI systems for Large Language Models.



I believe that AGI is within reach and could become a reality in the next few years. In my view, multimodal
models represent the next major breakthrough in the AI field, enabling LLMs to develop reasoning
capabilities for actions and movements through video data and interactive simulations. To contribute to this
vision, my research focuses on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and optimizing multimodal
model efficiency, with an emphasis on embodied AI where LLMs are trained in simulation environments.
