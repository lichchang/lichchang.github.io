I am a **first-year Ph.D. student** at **NC State University**, Department of Computer Science, advised by **Prof. Dongkuan Xu**.


My research focuses on **Efficient Embodied AI** and **Agentic AI systems** for **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.


I strongly believe that **AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is within reach** and could become a reality in the next few years.


My research aims to **enhance LLM reasoning** and **optimize multimodal model efficiency**.
I focus on **embodied AI**, where LLMs are trained in **simulation environments** to improve real-world adaptability.

Feel free to connect with me if you're interested in collaborating or discussing related topics!
