I am a first-year Ph.D. student at NC State University CSC, advised by Prof. Dongkuan Xu.

I earned a Master's in Computer Science from NC State University and another Master of Science from National Chi Nan University in Taiwan back in 2020.

My research interests lie in Efficient Embodied AI and Agentic AI systems for Large Language Models.
