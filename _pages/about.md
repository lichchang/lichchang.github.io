I am a **first-year Ph.D. student** at **NC State University**, Department of Computer Science, advised by **Prof. Dongkuan Xu**.


My research focuses on **Efficient Embodied AI** and **Agentic AI systems** for Large Language Models.


I strongly believe that AGI is within reach and could become a reality in the next few years, as multimodal models would enable LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities for actions and movements through video data and interactive simulations.


My research aims to enhance LLM reasoning and optimize model inference efficiency.
I focus on **embodied AI**, where LLMs are trained in **simulation environments** to improve real-world adaptability.
